##LAB 1:

Write a program that implements the following disk-scheduling algorithms:
...a. FCFS - first come first serve
...b. SSTF - sortest path to next head movement
...c. SCAN - scan to zero and then back up - given start head location
...d. C-SCAN - scan to end of disk then back down - given start head location
...e. LOOK 
...f. C-LOOK 

...Your program will service a disk with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0 to 4,999. The program will generate a random 
...series of 1,000 cylinder requests and service them according to each of the algorithms listed above. The 
...program will be passed the initial position of the disk head (as a parameter on the command line) and report 
...the total amount of head movement required by each algorithm.
